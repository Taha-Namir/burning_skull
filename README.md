# burning_skull
a simple game developed with the minilibx library !

to run the game, use make to get the executable file, then,
  run it with two arguments (first for the file and the second for the map)
 
 EXEMPLE :
    $./so_long "./sprites/map2.ber"
  
  so_long is the name of the executable and the second argument is the map.
